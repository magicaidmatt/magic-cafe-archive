That goal keeps going up. It was 13,000 at the beginning.<br><br>I wish Dan the best. But this doesn't bode well for people waiting for their books. If he already spent the money he took in for them, that means he has to motivate himself to get work done for free.

I'm concerned about Dan's struggles emotional as well as financial. Of course you help out if you can to those in need.<br>My concern is in getting the "real" help one needs to getting on the road to overall health and financial stability.<br><br>Many times providing a monetary band-aid  helps for "A time"<br>but if there are issues that are not addressed  then the problem repeats itself. My hope and prayer is that the Root Causes of the struggles are truly addressed  so there is a road map to a successful, long lasting recovery.</div>

Absolutely @davidpaul$. This is actually really concerning. Dan seemingly has had a long and successful career. And yet after choosing(?) to go out on his own, he has had to ask for financial help to buy a new computer and now to pay his mortgage?<br><br>He posted this:<br><div class="quote">Quote:<div class="quote_inner"><blockquote>On Dec 20, 2024, DanHarlan wrote:<br>I will be checking in here everyday... like I used to. I think I just need to get back into my fully-structured routine. </blockquote></div></div><br>Yet he has barely posted here since.<br><br>I feel bad for those who preordered and want to receive what they paid for. But I also think Dan has bigger concerns and I am worried about him too.

I really have been resisting saying anything because it seems I’m in the minority, but I genuinely can’t believe Dan asks for money on go fund me and people are donating thousands to his “cause.” I love when the magic community support one another like when a magician needs surgery or loses everything in a house fire, or some other big life event that is unpreventable. But this…this just irritates me. He said in his update he’s even thought about getting a *gasp* real job. As if that’s the worst thing in the world. As the previous poster mentioned, not long ago there was a go fund me to buy him a new computer. Then all of us that preordered his book paid for his wedding and his living for a year. Now this and I GUARANTEE this will not be the last go fund me. I just find it hard to feel sorry for someone who is making choices leading them down their path.  <br><br>He isn’t spending his time writing his magic book, he isn’t spending his time getting a real job… what is he doing all day? Why have sympathy for someone who is asking for a handout without standing behind what they’ve said they’re going to do?<br><br>Clearly, you people are way better than I am as a human. Dan’s a great creator which is why I was happy to support his work despite his flawed past, but eventually someone has to face the consequences of their choices or they’ll keep repeating the same choices time and time again. <br><br>Madison</div>

Somewhere deep down, you know that you’re just digging a hole if your mortgage is going unpaid. I was raised different, I guess. If there were bills to be paid, you got a second job, sold off some items that help cover the cost.  Books, props, even intellectual property. Can’t afford where you live? Sell it and downsize.   Being $33k in the hole didn’t happen overnight. I feel for Dan and his family, but this just seems to have been an easy out to ask for money. The way the GoFundMe just kept stretching rubbed me the wrong way. Originally asking for $13k, is not insurmountable, but it kept creeping up, and it was evident that this wasn’t a small amount needed to bridge some lean times. <br><br>The whole thing was handled poorly, from the Masterworks, his excuses that he didn’t sell enough presales, to the GoFundMe.  In this economy $30k doesn’t last long. I really hope he gets his life turned around.

I'm not a subscriber to (and indeed wasn't even aware of) the Masterworks, so I've tried to catch up reading this thread. The $299 subscription cost is more than what I was going to donate, but maybe that's a better way to get Dan the money as then I'm also subscribed to the project?<br><br>From what I understand, the fundraising link that's been posted is simply a donation and not linked to also becoming a Masterworks subscriber.

One just has to be careful when giving money with what you believe is from a compassionate heart is not in fact being an <br>"enabler".

People have to be accountable for their financial decisions. And yes, if you need to sell and downsize or get a "real" job then go do that. The GoFundMe stuff has also rubbed me the wrong way. It seems Dan has made a mess of his finances to include taking preorders (wildly overestimating the number he would get) and so far not meeting his commitments.<br><br>However, none of that lessens my worries about him, as this seems to be a symptom of a larger mental health issue.

As harsh as my comments may have seemed, I don’t wish Dan any harm. I value his work as a creator and I still think he was the best Penguin live host. That Tarbell series took a ton of work and time and passion and he pulled it off with outstanding results. I empathize with his mental health issues, but as others have said, I don’t think throwing tens of thousands of dollars to someone with clear needs beyond the advertised ones is the correct answer. He has always seemed to be a stand up guy. It seems life keeps throwing punches at him. But at the same time you have to think if someone keeps punching you, maybe it’s time to look around and step out of the boxing ring. If that’s too big of a step, then maybe get a coach (some help) and learn to start defending against those punches. <br><br>Madison</div>
