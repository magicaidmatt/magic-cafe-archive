I must admit, I'm feeling a bit hesitant to sneak back into this conversation. Please don't throw anything at me. It's been ages since I last posted. I haven't even had a chance to check-in at the Cafe for quite a while. Honestly, I'm embarrassed about my lengthy absence, and I know I owe all of you an explanation. Simply put, my life has been a whirlwind, to say the least. But I can hear you scream: "Where's my MasterWorks!?" I truly apologize for not keeping in touch with those of you who have placed your trust in me regarding this important project. I hope you can forgive my absence. I've been navigating my own challenges, but I realize I should be better at letting you know what's happening. Please rest assured, MasterWorks is still very much alive! I'm actively working on it, although it has encountered a few bumps along the road... something that shouldn’t come as a shock... but I really felt I was going to be able to overcome life's challenges with more aplomb.<br><br>I know there's nothing I can say that will correct my current situation. I'm behind schedule. Nothing can change that. Also, I know you're not interested in excuses, but you're likely curious about why progress has been slower than expected and what has caused the delays. Here we go...<br><br>I had always intended to dedicate much more time to MasterWorks. Sadly, the initial response was a bit of a letdown. No offense to all of you who signed up -- you are the reason I'm as far along as I am! A huge, heartfelt "Thank YOU!" to all my subscribers. I know you're struggling to stay positive and I haven't helped. I swear to you... your patience will be rewarded. My results have always been worth the wait. However, as I said, I was anticipating (and preparing for) a response that was at least five times bigger than what I actually got. Because I was unable to raise the required capital investment, I've had to diversify. Naturally, I have bills to pay, just like everyone else. And as any magician will tell you, making a living in this field is no walk in the park. Essentially, I received only enough initial income to support myself and my family's basic needs for about a year. So, I’ve had to keep touring and accept other gigs to make ends meet. I've even considered getting a "normal" job. Yes, it's been a struggle.<br><br>Also, as you may have heard, I now have a computer which is better equipped for my needs. My old computer was not up to the challenge to handle all the files and layout I've been putting together. After all, MasterWorks is 54 years of my life! A conservative estimate of 300 gigs and growing each day. I was constantly frustrated with the sluggish pace and intermittent crashes, but I just didn't have any extra money to spend. More accurately, I tend to put my needs last, and I just kept pushing on through the frustration. <br><br>Most embarrassingly, I've been wrestling with some feelings of depression and a nagging sense of inadequacy. I hope you realize how uncomfortable it makes me to admit all of this. That's why it has taken me so long to share. Ultimately, my lack of time, money, and motivation does not excuse me from fulfilling my promise to you. I chose to take on all this work, and I am committed to seeing it through, regardless of whether anyone cares or not. I genuinely hope it will be beneficial to everyone who owns it. I often do big projects... not because they'll be easy... rather, I do it because I believe in contributing to help others. My time here is limited and I'd like to spend it positively influencing the future.<br><br>So, I humbly ask my current subscribers to extend me a bit more grace and patience. You deserve my best and I simply have to correct my course in order to deliver it. I also realize the only way I can generate excitement and interest in MasterWorks is to have more finished pages to show. I have enlisted the services of a co-writer/collaborator who will help me stick to a regular schedule. My family is aware of my struggles and are incredibly supportive. The rest is up to me...</div>

I have no horse in this race either as I have not subscribed. However, I can vouch for Dan's generosity and kindness.<br><br>About 25 years ago or so (memory's a bit hazy), I brought a group of about 7 or 8 of my personal students to Dan's lecture when he was in Vancouver. He offered me a private jam session for my students after the lecture finished and didn't ask for a single penny. He did this out of the goodness of his heart. My students sure appreciated it and so did I. And if that wasn't enough, after the jam session was done, he and I and his gal at the time (Pandora) went to a Goth bar downtown for a few hours. Wouldn't let me buy a drink the whole night; he paid for them all out of his own pocket and he and I continued jamming while Pandora danced away on the dance floor the whole time. The guy has a genuinely good heart. <br><br>Life sucks sometimes. Sometimes you get thrown too many curveballs all at once and you can't catch them all and things get messed up. I've been through it. We'd like to think that we would handle things better when these things occur, but the fact is, you don't actually know how you will handle it until it happens to you.<br><br>It takes a set to come on here and explain your situation calmly and with humbleness - especially in light of some of the nasty comments that have been posted here.<br><br>Keep your chin up, Dan.</div>

I too did not preorder -- precisely because this situation is all too common even when people have the best of intentions. It's easy to underestimate the workload and your pace of progress, particularly when you haven't done this before and you take on such a monumental project.<br><br>However, depression is no joke. It can severely damage your quality of life and kill your ability to accomplish even the simplest things. It recently destroyed the career and reputation of a formerly popular and well-known magician for years, and he is now struggling to resurrect both. To attack Dan so harshly when you're not even out any money speaks volumes about your character.<br><br>Perhaps this should have been a Kickstarter. Then Dan could have set a fundraising goal that made it financially feasible to move forward. And I understand the people who are upset at the lack of communication -- that would have gone a long way towards calming things down a bit. At this point I would suggest more communication and perhaps refunds for those who want them. But that is ultimately up to Dan and his subscribers. As for me, once the Masterworks are complete I will consider purchasing a copy.

As someone who does have a horse in this race, I can only add that I’m more interested in supporting Dan through this hard time than money. <br><br>Since my last post, he’s replied and I’ve let him know that he doesn’t need to worry about refunding. I’d love to hear his story, but not at any price. <br><br>As someone who has given so much to the art/hobby/profession that we all love, he owes me nothing. <br><br>Dan - take care of yourself and focus on your health and those close to you.

Life happens man. Cut Dan some slack. Geez. With all he’s done over the years and how great his reputation is, he didn’t all of a sudden become some thief that lives in the shadows. Give the man some time to sort things out. How many of you who are whining has a perfect life????  hahaha. That’s what I thought!

I am not one of those that has pre-ordered, just been following the thread to see how progress has been coming along as I may be interested in purchasing this as well.  I don't know Dan personally, though it seems as if I do with all of the DVDs, Tarbell lessons, tutorials and Penguin live lectures that I have seen through the decades.  From what I have seen, Dan has given so much to the magic community with his knowledge and wonderful teaching style.  Stories like Sudo has shared, I can see that being the norm with many people that have encountered Dan.  I struggle to think of anyone else who has given back to the magic community as much as Dan has.<br><br>Dan, thanks for coming on here and providing an update.  It is appreciated.  Just know that you are loved and you have people (many that you are not aware of) rooting for you.  I hope sometime in the future we will be able to cross paths and meet, but in the meantime I will be praying for you and your family.<br><br>To others who have pre-ordered and are still waiting, I understand how you can be upset.  I hope this works out for everyone in the end.  Anyways, just my two cents.  Hope you all have a Merry Christmas, and reach out to your friends and family and make sure to give them a hug.  Time goes by so fast and life is too short.  I can't believe I have been a member of this community for over 20 years.  I have never been a member of any other online community as long as this one, there is just something special about our brotherhood of magicians.  And if anyone is struggling with depression and needs someone to talk to, reach out to a friend or family member.  Heck, reach out to me if you want to. Love you all, take care.
