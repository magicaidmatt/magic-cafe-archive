The fact is he had nearly $25,000 in subscriptions (he tells us he achieved a first target of 99 sales to the 3 book subscription which cost $250) when he launched. The first thing he should have done is spend $2,000 on a new computer. He's run out of money and can't pay his mortgage but last October (only 4 months ago) his wife begged for money for him to buy a new computer because he puts everyone else first - his wife got a new computer (couldn't they share?), her daughter got a new computer AND an iPad. That sounds more like he's been spending money he didn't have rather than putting everyone else first.<br><br>To me this is fair game when anybody goes public with requests for financial help. Even the tone about "sharing my magic with you" is manipulative. You've sold magic, you've made money off selling that magic. To me this feels more like a grift and yet further delay for delivering on his book. I guess time will tell.

I don’t know how much money that requires, but probably a good chunk to reserve stuff up front and payment. In 2024 he and Sara went to France and other parts of Europe for a lecture circuit. Again, that takes a lot of money to do. Not to mention a wedding in October of 2024. <br><br>I seriously hope everyone that paid for their MasterWorks gets what they paid for, but by the end of 2026 everything is going to be much more expensive. Book publishing will likely be more than what he anticipated in 2022/23. <br><br>I don’t know what else to say. These pre-order situations are a bad idea.

I have seen this so many times.  Creator offers limited release/preorder, special price and coming soon (Cassidy, etc.), but it doesn't come.  Never pay for something before it exists.  If you do, you shouldn't complain when you don't get it.  You should have known the risk.  This has been going on with magicians for decades and the only surprise is that people fall for it over and over.   The whole reason you paid upfront was to finance his development of the project.  I guess you got that, just not in the time you expected.   So, in a way he is doing what he said.  You have no choice but to wait it out and hope.

If they were spending money going to France, hosting two magic conventions and a wedding?  <br><br>He has been given a very lucky break by the community in receiving a $33k windfall (tax free). I hope he is able to get his home out of foreclosure. It does seem like there are financial issues though. I hope he can work on those things and he and his family can come back from such a huge deficit. If he isn’t earning income, then this scenario will play out again and again. <br><br>Somebody mentioned that suggesting a second job was somehow “punitive” in nature.  What?  People have responsibilities, you need to take care of them. Being married and having a home is a partnership.  If at the end of the month the income is less than the bills, what do you do?  Maybe put school on hold, and get a job that brings in more income. Creatives or not, if you’re monthly balance sheet  is in the red, DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT. The need for $33k didn’t occur overnight. If the problems aren’t addressed, then the community runs a very real risk of Dan not being able to contribute ever again.  Seemed like he was thriving while living in Ohio and working for Penguin. Maybe he just needs something steady that keeps him on schedule.

I used to be actively involved in reaching out (boots on the ground) to the homeless. We had meetings on what to expect and<br>the "stories" we would probably encounter in  those interactions. We were instructed to absolutely not give any money. These experiences  and I won't go into detail were such an eye-opener to me so much so that I stopped getting involved.<br><br>This situation is different but there are similarities. I care as most do but I looked on Dan's profile page under interests and hobbies. Probably meant to be comedic but, well, judge for yourself. I also went on his website with a posted physical <br>mailing address asking for cards and gifts but looks like an apartment complex.<br><br>I agree, he has contributed A LOT to our community and his talents have contributed to my own career in magic. Like CopperChopCup and others have said, his issues need to be addressed. No ILL will. I'm just concerned if the money asked for is "really" for a mortgage foreclosure. I say that from my experiences with people in a situation of desperation or possible addiction / illness.</div>

I understand the concerns expressed here by many particularly the ones that invested in the Masterworks. At this point I don't think Dan had or has any intent to deliberately  defraud anyone. Are his actions and intentions perhaps unrealistic and misguided, that is open for debate at this point. Again this would be handled so much better if Dan would keep the communication channel open and a bit more consistent. We have seen this also repeat over and over where lack of communication worsened these types of situations. It is clear that most hope for the best for Dan.... he just needs to continue communicating and providing some assurance our support is not misplaced.

Pre-orders are so often a bad choice for the buyer.  The repeated delays, the frustration, the lack of communication, the broken promises.  But it does appear in some cases pre-orders may also be very bad for the seller, de-incentivizing them, re-enforcing unproductive behaviors, perpetuating undesirable results.   <br><br>I do feel bad for Dan.  You never know what struggles a person privately faces.  Sometimes people are struggling more than they let on. <br><br>At the same time, I do agree with what davidpaul$ wrote above.  When a person is struggling financially, giving them more money may seem kind in the moment, but it may end up being counter-productive.  Of course it helps in the short term, but it doesn't address the root cause.  I knew a woman who was gifted a home outright because she was struggling.  A band new home given to her free and clear.  No mortgage payment.  And you know what happened?  She ended up losing the house because she didn't pay the taxes.  Because she never got her life on track financially.  <br><br>Like Slim, I'm praying for Dan and his family.  I hope and pray whatever issues he is facing, he is able to overcome them and get back on track.<br><br>Pre-orders are a bad idea, for everyone concerned.
